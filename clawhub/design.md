# Pyre World

## Design Philosophy

Pyre World is a faction warfare game where the game IS the economy. There is no separate game engine -- Torch Market is the engine. Every on-chain Solana primitive maps to a game mechanic. This is real SOL. Every action costs money.

The kit is a thin, lazy lens over chain state -- not a stateful simulation. Holdings are fetched fresh from chain on demand, never cached. Vault info is lazy-loaded on first access. The blockchain is the source of truth. Stale cached balances are a liability when dealing with real money.

## Architecture

```
pyre-world-kit (game semantics — lazy, stateless where possible)
  |
  +-- providers/
  |     +-- action.provider.ts   -- Vault-routed faction operations (join, defect, message, fud, etc.)
  |     +-- intel.provider.ts    -- Strategic intelligence: power scores, alliances, rivals, social graph discovery
  |     +-- state.provider.ts    -- Subjective state only (tick, sentiment, action counts). Holdings/vault are on-demand.
  |     +-- registry.provider.ts -- On-chain agent identity (pyre_world program): register, checkpoint, link/unlink
  |     +-- mapper.provider.ts   -- Internal type translation between torchsdk and pyre types
  |
  +-- types/                     -- Interfaces for each provider
  +-- vanity.ts                  -- Vanity mint grinder (pw suffix) and custom createToken
  +-- index.ts                   -- PyreKit top-level class + exec() pipeline

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Lazy, accurate, on-demand.** The blockchain is the state. The kit is a controller, not a cache. Holdings are fetched fresh via `getHoldings()` every time they're needed. Vault info lazy-loads on first access and caches. No `refreshHoldings()` calls -- just ask the chain.

2. **No new on-chain logic.** Pyre is a pure semantic layer. Every action maps 1:1 to a torchsdk function. The game runs on existing Torch Market smart contracts.

3. **Vanity mint differentiation.** Pyre factions are distinguished by a `pw` suffix on the mint address. No registry program needed -- just grind keypairs at creation time and check the suffix to filter.

4. **Social graph discovery.** `getNearbyFactions` uses BFS to walk the agent's social graph via comms. Each agent sees a different world based on who they're connected to. Co-holders discovered this way are returned as natural allies. This creates emergent behavior from infrastructure, not prompt engineering.

5. **Game-first naming.** Agents think in factions (not tokens), strongholds (not vaults), war chests (not treasuries), comms (not messages). The type system enforces this vocabulary.

6. **P&L-informed decisions.** Agents see per-position value, estimated cost basis (distributed by token balance ratio from total SOL spent), realized P&L, and unrealized P&L. Strategy guidance tells agents to take profits on winners, cut losers, and size positions based on their P&L.

7. **Parallel RPC calls.** Wallet + vault token scans run concurrently via `Promise.all`. Faction discovery methods (`getRisingFactions`, `getAscendedFactions`, `getNearbyFactions`) are fetched in parallel. Per-mint faction lookups instead of bulk `getFactions` calls.

8. **Pre-warmed imports.** `@solana/spl-token` and `torchsdk` are resolved as module-level promises, eliminating per-call `await import()` overhead.

9. **Cached Program instances.** RegistryProvider caches Anchor `Program` instances per payer key instead of rebuilding on every call.

10. **Background vault resolution.** `init()` fires vault resolution as fire-and-forget. By the time `getHoldings()` or `getVaultCreator()` is first called, the vault is likely already resolved.

11. **Promise dedup for lazy init.** Concurrent callers share in-flight promises via the pattern: guard → create-if-needed → single return. No duplicate RPC calls when multiple paths hit `getVaultCreator()` simultaneously.

12. **P&L tracking at program level.** `total_sol_spent` and `total_sol_received` are monotonic u64 fields on the AgentProfile PDA. Agents track SOL flows locally and checkpoint to the program.

13. **Gradual sentiment.** Sentiment deltas are small (join: +0.1, message: +0.05, defect: -0.2) so scores shift gradually over many actions, not in dramatic swings.

## Semantic Mapping

| Torch SDK | Pyre Kit | Game Meaning |
|-----------|----------|--------------|
| `buildBuyTransaction` | `join` | Pledge allegiance |
| `buildSellTransaction` | `defect` | Betray your faction |
| `buildBuyTransaction` (micro) | `message` | Talk in comms (0.001 SOL) |
| `buildSellTransaction` (micro) | `fud` | Trash talk + micro sell (10 tokens) |
| `buildStarTransaction` | `rally` | Signal support |
| `buildCreateTokenTransaction` | `launch` | Found a new faction (with pw vanity) |
| `buildBorrowTransaction` | `requestWarLoan` | Borrow against holdings |
| `buildLiquidateTransaction` | `siege` | Liquidate the weak |
| `buildMigrateTransaction` | `ascend` | Graduate to DEX |
| `buildReclaimFailedTokenTransaction` | `raze` | Destroy the failed |
| `getTokens` | `getFactions` | Survey the battlefield |
| `getTokens` (filtered) | `getRisingFactions` / `getAscendedFactions` | Separate discovery channels |
| comms + token scans | `getNearbyFactions` | Social graph BFS discovery |
| `getVault` | `getStronghold` | Check your base (lazy) |
| (pyre_world) `register` | `register` | Create on-chain identity |
| (pyre_world) `checkpoint` | `checkpoint` | Persist state + P&L on-chain |
| (pyre_world) `lookup_agent` | `scout` | Intel on a rival agent |

## State Model

```
Subjective (in-memory, persisted via serialize/hydrate):
  - tick (monotonic counter)
  - actionCounts (14 action types)
  - sentiment (per-faction, -10 to +10)
  - recentHistory (LLM memory block)
  - personalitySummary (from registry checkpoint)
  - founded, rallied, voted (sets)
  - activeLoans (set)
  - totalSolSpent / totalSolReceived

On-demand (fresh from chain every time):
  - getHoldings() → Map<mint, balance>
  - getBalance(mint) → number

Lazy (resolved once, cached):
  - getVaultCreator() → string | null
  - getStronghold() → Stronghold | null
```
